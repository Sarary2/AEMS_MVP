DURING THE ARREST IT WAS NOTED THAT HE HAD A FAULTY TEGO CAP ATTACHED TO HIS 'VASCATH'. THE CAP ITSELF APPEARS TO HAVE A PIECE OF SILICON TORN AT THE TOP OF THE CAP (WHERE THE SYRINGE ATTACHES). THE FAULT WAS NOTICED BY NURSES WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO USE A SYRINGE TO ASPIRATE BLOOD (DURING THE ARREST). THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO THIS AND WERE ALSO UNABLE TO ACHIEVE A (LEUR) LOCK ON THE SYRINGE. THIS WAS DETERMINED TO NOT BE THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THE PATIENT. IT WAS NOTED TO BE AN INCIDENTAL FINDING THAT DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEATH, OR CPR. THE CAP ITSELF WAS SENT WITH THE BODY TO THE CORONER."" THE EVENT OCCURRED DURING PATIENT USE. THERE WAS INJURY REPORTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT, BUT NO ELECTROMECHANICAL DEVICE WERE AUDIBLE OR VISUAL ALARMS GENERATED. THERE WAS NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED.

RELATED TO REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT (NEEDLE NOT RETRACTING WHEN BUTTON IS PUSHED THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH MULTIPLE IVS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO THIS FACILITY). Manufacturer Narrative: A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW WAS COMPLETED BY OUR QUALITY ENGINEER TEAM FOR PROVIDED MATERIAL NUMBER 382534 AND LOT NUMBER 4303346. THE REVIEW DID NOT REVEAL ANY DETECTED ABNORMALITIES DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DEFECT AND ALL QUALITY TESTS WERE FOUND TO BE WITHIN SPECIFICATION. AS A SAMPLE WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN, A THOROUGH SAMPLE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS, AN EXACT CAUSE FOR THIS INCIDENT COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. THERE ARE QUALITY CONTROLS CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO DETECT THIS TYPE OF DEFECT DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. FURTHER ACTION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED NECESSARY AT THIS TIME. COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FOR THIS DEVICE AND REPORTED CONDITION WILL CONTINUE TO BE TRACKED AND TRENDED. OUR QUALITY TEAM REGULARLY REVIEWS THE COLLECTED DATA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGING TRENDS."

NO ADVERSE PATIENT CONSEQUENCE WAS REPORTED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A CASE, DISTORTED SIGNALS ON ALL INTRACARDIAL AND BODY SURFACE ELECTROGRAMS WERE OBSERVED TO A LEVEL OF NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK PROPERLY WITH THOSE SIGNALS. CHECKING THE CONNECTIONS OF THE RECORDING SYSTEM DID HELP A LITTLE, IMPROVING THE SHOWN SIGNALS, BUT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ONLY THEN, FIFTEEN (15) MINUTES AFTER NOTICING THE ISSUES, A ""CURRENT LEAKAGE"" ERROR APPEARED ON THE CARTO SCREEN. THEY THEN CONTINUED THE PROTOCOL, DISCONNECTED THE BODY SURFACE CABLE, AS WELL AS ALL CATHETER CABLES FROM THE PATIENT INTERFACE UNIT (PIU). AFTER RESTARTING THE PIU, THEY STARTED TO CONNECT THE BODY SURFACE CABLE, AS WELL AS EACH OF THE CATHETER CABLES AGAIN ONE BY ONE. THIS WAY, THE THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF CATHETER (STSF), LOT 31210799L) CONNECTED TO THE MAP PORT, COULD BE IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKAGE CURRENT. AFTER CHECKING THE CONNECTIONS, NO ABNORMALITIES OR BENT PINS COULD BE DETECTED. THE CABLE WAS THEN REPLACED, THE PIU GOT RESTARTED AND THE LEAKAGE CURRENT ERROR RETURNED. AGAIN, AFTER SAME TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE, THE MAP CATHETER COULD BE IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF PROBLEM AGAIN. THE CATHETER WAS THEN REPLACED, THE PIU GOT RESTARTED ONCE MORE, AND THE ERROR DID NOT RESOLVE. A PENTARAY CATHETER ALSO HAD TO BE DISMISSED FOR THIS CASE. THE CASE WAS THEN CONVERTED TO A COMPETITOR DEVICE. AFTER THE CASE, THE TWO CABLES, AS WELL AS BOTH STSF CATHETERS WERE EXAMINED AGAIN WITH MORE DETAILED CARE. THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND SOME CORROSION, CAUSED BY SOME SORT OF FLUID (PROBABLY FLUSHING NACL SOLUTION). THE MOISTURE MUST HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM THE FIRST CABLE TO THE FIRST CATHETER, TO THE SECOND CABLE AND THE SECOND CATHETER. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION WAS RECEIVED ON 11-MAR-2025. IT WAS REPORTED THAT SIGNAL INTERFERENCE WAS ON BOTH THE CARTO AND RECORDING SYSTEM. THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT HAVE ANY INTACT ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) SIGNAL AVAILABLE TO MONITOR PATIENT HEART RHYTHM. DURING THE SIGNAL INTERFERENCE, THE AFFECTED CATHETERS WERE INSIDE THE PATIENT¿S BODY. SIGNAL NOISE WAS AN ISSUE ON BOTH STSF CATHETERS. AS SUCH, THE EVENT IS NOW CONSIDERED MDR REPORTABLE WITH AN AWARENESS DATE OF 11-MAR-2025. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PATIENT WAS DEEP SEDATED WITH LOCAL ANESTHESIA. NO INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED THAT DAY. THE CORROSION WAS SEEN ON BOTH THE CABLES AND THE CATHETERS, AS THE FLUID TRANSFERRED DURING EACH CHANGE OF CABLES AND CATHETERS.

THE DEVICE STORAGE TEMPERATURE DID NOT EXCEED 25 °C. THE USER IS TRAINED TO THE DEVICE. A NON-CORDIS SHEATH WAS USED. THERE WERE NO MULTIPLE SHEATH EXCHANGES. THE STOPCOCK OF THE INTRODUCER SHEATH WAS OPENED PRIOR TO SHUTTLE DOWN. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE WHEN SHUTTLING DOWN. THERE WAS NO EXCESSIVE FORCE APPLIED WHEN SHUTTLING DOWN. THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL FORCE APPLIED WHEN RETRACTING THE SHEATH. THE DEPLOYER DID NOT OVER-TAMP. THE DEPLOYER DID NOT FAIL TO MAINTAIN TENSION ON THE CATHETER WHILE TAMPING. THERE WERE NO KINKS IN THE SHEATH OR DEVICE AFTER REMOVAL. OTHER PROCEDURAL DETAILS WERE REQUESTED BUT WERE NOT PROVIDED. THE PRODUCT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE STERILE LOT NUMBER WAS NOT AVAILABLE, DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW COULD NOT BE PERFORMED. BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW A CONCLUSION ABOUT A CLINICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEVICE AND THE EVENT. WITHOUT THE RETURN OF THE DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS, THE REPORTED CUSTOMER COMPLAINT OF "" COMPONENT COMPONENT ISSUE AND SEALANT FAILURE TO DEPLOY"" COULD NOT BE EVALUATED. WITHOUT THE RETURN OF THE DEVICE AND WITH NO PROCEDURAL FILMS THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FACTORS RELATED TO THE PROCEDURE, HANDLING, AND/OR PATIENT ANATOMY CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), WHICH IS NOT INTENDED AS A MITIGATION, ¿WHILE PULLING LIGHTLY ON THE DEVICE HANDLE (TO ENSURE THE BALLOON IS ABUTTING THE ARTERIOTOMY OR VENOTOMY), OPEN THE PROCEDURAL SHEATH STOPCOCK AND CONFIRM TEMPORARY HEMOSTASIS. DETACH SHUTTLE AND ADVANCE IN A CONTINUOUS MOTION UNTIL A DEFINITIVE STOP IS FELT. IMMEDIATELY GRASP THE PROCEDURAL SHEATH AND WITHDRAW IT FROM THE TISSUE TRACT. CONTINUE RETRACTING UNTIL THE SHUTTLE LOCKS ON THE HANDLE.¿ IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IF THE SHUTTLE IS NOT ADVANCED UNTIL THE ADVANCER TUBE IS ENGAGED TO THE PROXIMAL TAMP LOCK (DEFINITIVE STOP), THIS WILL CAUSE THE ADVANCER TUBE AND SEALANT TO FOLLOW THE SHUTTLE CARTRIDGE BACK OUT OF THE TISSUE TRACT DURING THE RETRACTION STEP, RESULTING IN THE DEVICE FAILING TO DEPLOY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE EVENT IS RELATED TO THE DEVICE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THEREFORE, NO PREVENTATIVE OR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME."

THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT AS THE ISSUE WAS FOUND WHILST THE DEVICE WAS NOT IN USE ON A PATIENT. Manufacturer Narrative: (B)(4). FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE (F&P) IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING OUR INVESTIGATION. WE WILL PROVIDE A FOLLOW UP REPORT UPON COMPLETION OF OUR INVESTIGATION. PRODUCT BACKGROUND: THE OPT944 OPTIFLOW + ADULT NASAL CANNULA IS A NASAL CANNULA PATIENT INTERFACE FOR DELIVERY OF HUMIDIFIED RESPIRATORY GASES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING NASAL HIGH FLOW THERAPY (NHF). THE CANNULA CONSISTS OF A LIGHTWEIGHT DELIVERY TUBE CONNECTED TO A RIGID PLASTIC BASE AND SOFT NASAL PRONGS (NASAL INTERFACE). THIS ALLOWS THE DEVICE TO BE LIGHT WEIGHT AND DURABLE. THE INTERFACE IS HELD IN PLACE BY A HEAD STRAP AND FEATURES A HEAD STRAP CLIP WHICH WORKS IN TANDEM WITH THE TUBING CLIP (ATTACHES TO THE PATIENT'S CLOTHING/BEDDING) TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE CIRCUIT AND PREVENT THE CANNULA BEING DISLODGED. OPTIFLOW + INTERFACES ARE DESIGNED FOR USE WITH THE AIRVO SERIES HUMIDIFIERS AND ARE ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH THE FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE (F&P) MR850 AND 950 HUMIDIFICATION SYSTEM DEVICES.

THE ANALYSIS IS THUS BASED ON THE INSPECTION OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTS OF THE DEVICE AS WELL AS ON THE PROVIDED DATA. THE QUALITY DOCUMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THIS DEVICE WERE RE-INVESTIGATED. ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROVIDED TREND DATA, ACQUIRED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2024 AND 13TH OF MARCH 2025 RECORDED A STABLE PACING IMPEDANCE OF 400 OHMS AND SHOCK IMPEDANCE OF 60 OHMS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROVIDED IEGM EPISODES REVEALED ARTIFACTS ON THE RV CHANNEL, WHICH LED TO THE REPORTED OVERSENSING. IN SPITE OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION, NO CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN REGARDING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CLINICAL OBSERVATION. AN ANALYSIS OF THE LEAD ITSELF WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE. SHOULD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR THE DEVICE ITSELF BECOME AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS, THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE UPDATED.

Manufacturer Narrative: COMBINATION PRODUCT: YES. UPON RECEIPT, THE LEAD UNDER COMPLAINT WAS SUBJECTED TO AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEAD WAS SCRUTINIZED, INCLUDING A VISUAL, MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL INSPECTION. THE VISUAL ANALYSIS REVEALED A SLIGHTLY SQUEEZED CONDUCTOR COIL 45 CM DISTAL TO THE IS-1 CONNECTOR PIN, WHICH MOST LIKELY RESULTED FROM THE SURGERY. HOWEVER, A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE LEAD DID NOT SHOW ANY DEVIATIONS WHICH MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS. THE VALUES OF THE PARAMETERS MEASURED DURING THE MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS WERE WITHIN THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. PRIOR TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE, THE QUALITY DOCUMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THIS DEVICE WERE RE-INVESTIGATED. ALL PRODUCTION STEPS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDINGLY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE TEST PROVED THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS TO BE AS SPECIFIED.

IT WAS REPORTED BY CUSTOMER THAT THE DRUG MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL (MMF) WAS RUNNING BUT BEEPING OFF AIR IN LINE ERROR. WRITER WENT TO ROOM TO FIX THE AIR IN LINE. ONCE THE PUMP WAS OPENED AND THE MMF LINE WAS TAKEN OUT, IT IMMEDIATELY BROKE IN HALF AND THE DRUG WAS SPILLING OUT. Manufacturer Narrative: H.3. IF A DEVICE EVALUATION AND/OR DEVICE HISTORY REVIEW IS COMPLETED, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED Manufacturer Narrative: ONE SAMPLE WAS RECEIVED FOR QUALITY INVESTIGATION. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLE INDICATES THAT THE PRODUCT SEPARATED AT THE UPPER PUMPING SEGMENT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE SILICONE TUBING INDICATES THAT THERE IS NO SIGN OF INDENTION ON THE SILICONE TUBING AND THE SECUREMENT COLLAR WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH THE SAMPLE. THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT OF SEPARATION WAS CONFIRMED. INVESTIGATION FOR THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS MOVED TO MANUFACTURING FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. AFTER THE INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH MANUFACTURING, MAINTENANCE AND QUALITY OPERATIONS TEAM, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MOST POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE SEPARATION BETWEEN SILICONE TUBING AND LOWER FITMENT IS A GRIPPER MISALIGNMENT OF THE ASSEMBLY EQUIPMENT. SIMILAR ISSUES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO CORRECT THE ISSUE WITH A WORK ORDER CONDUCTED ON NOVEMBER 14 , 2024. THE SAMPLE INFUSION SET WAS MANUFACTURED ON NOVEMBER 13, 2024, AND THEREFORE NO FURTHER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE CONSIDERED NECESSARY. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW FOR MODEL 2426-0007 LOT NUMBER 24115250 WAS PERFORMED. THERE WERE NO QUALITY NOTIFICATIONS ISSUED FOR THE FAILURE MODE REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER DURING THE PRODUCTION BUILD OF THIS SET.

THE MAX DIAMETER WAS 4.1MM AND THE NECK DIAMETER WAS 3.3MM. THE DISTAL LANDING ZONE WAS 3.23MM AND THE PROXIMAL LANDING ZONE WAS 5.07MM. VESSEL TORTOSITY WAS MODERATE. THE PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION DEVICE WAS SELECTED FOR USE BASED ON 3D MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, THE DISTAL SECTION OF THE DEVICE FAILED TO OPEN, AND THE TIP WAS FOUND TO BE DAMAGED. THE PED-475-20 MODEL WAS SELECTED BASED ON THE 3D MEASUREMENT. PHENOM27 SUCCESSFULLY REACHED THE IPSILATERAL MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY M1 UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SYCHRO 0.014 INCHES, AND THEN THE STENT WAS OPENED, FULLY HYDRATED WITH HIGH-PRESSURE NORMAL SALINE, AND THEN DELIVERED IN PLACE. EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AT THIS TIME. THE SURGEON INTENDED TO DEPLOY IT IN SITU, FIX THE STENT PUSH ROD, WITHDRAW THE STENT CATHETER PHENOM27, EXPOSE THE STENT TIP, BUT THE STENT DID NOT OPEN. THEN IT WAS CONTINUED TO DEPLOY MORE PED. AFTER DEPLOYED ABOUT 15MM, THE PROXIMAL END EXPANDED, BUT THE TIP OF THE STENT STILL DID NOT OPEN. IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RETRIEVE PART OF THE STENT AND DEPLOY IT AGAIN. THIS TIME, IT WAS DEPLOYED FOR A LONGER DISTANCE, BUT THE TIP STILL COULD NOT OPEN. IT WAS PULLED A LITTLE BIT TOWARD THE PROXIMAL END AND SWUNG SLIGHTLY AS A WHOLE, BUT THE TIP OF THE STENT STILL COULD NOT OPEN. WAITING FOR REPEATED ADJUSTMENTS, BUT IT STILL COULD NOT OPEN. NON-SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY CONFIRMED THE TIP OF THE STENT, AND IT FELT THAT THE STATE WAS NOT NORMAL. IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REMOVE THE STENT PED AND PHENOM27 FROM THE BODY AS A WHOLE AND FOUND THAT THE TIP HAD BEEN DAMAGED. THE DEVICE WAS RESAHETHED AND REMOVED WITH THE MICROCATHETER AND REPLACED WITH A TUBRIDGE STENT FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER, WHICH WAS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED WITHOUT ISSUES. MORE THAN 50% OF THE DEVICE HAD BEEN DEPOLYED WHEN IT FAILED TO OPEN. THE PIPELINE WAS RESEHATHED LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO TWO TIMES. ADDITIONAL STEPS TAKEN TO OPEN THE PIPELINE INCLUDE DEPLOYING A LONGER DISTANCE, WAITING, SWINGING SLIGHTLY, RETRIEVING AND DEPLOYING AGAIN. THE DEVICES WERE PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE PROCEDURE INVOLVED FEMORAL ARTERY ACCESS WITH A DIAMETER OF 6.5MM, AND THE PATIENT RECEIVED DUAL ANTIPLATELET TREATMENT WITH NORMAL PLATELET REACTIVITY LEVELS. ANGIOGRAPHIC RESULTS POST-PROCEDURE WERE NORMAL, AND NO PATIENT SYMPTOMS OR COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED. NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. ANCILLARY DEVICES: 6F 90CM NEURON MAX SHEATH, 6F 115CM TETHYS GUIDECATHETERM PHENOM27 CATHETER, SYCHRO 0.014 (0.014 INCH) GUIDEWIRE, COILS.

TELADOC'S BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR FITS PATIENTS WITH UP TO A 42CM ARM CIRCUMFERENCE, THE PATIENT CONFIRMED THAT THEIR ARM IS WITHIN RANGE AS THEIR ARM IS NOT TOO SMALL OR TOO BIG. IT WAS NOT CONFIRMED IF THE PATIENT RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION DUE TO THE BRUISING. EVENT DESCRIPTION THE DEVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. IF THE DEVICE IS RETURNED, AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED. Manufacturer Narrative: CAUSE: TRANSTEK COULDN'T GET BACK THE DEVICES CONCERNING THE CASE DIRECTLY. THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR DEVICE FAILURES FROM OTHER FEEDBACKS AND THE CAUSE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE THE SAME THEORETICALLY AS BELOW. 1. CHECK THE APPEARANCE OF THE DEVICE AND CUFF, THERE IS NO DEFECT FOUND. 2. TAKE A MEASUREMENT AND CHECK THE SOUND OF PUMP, THE RESULT IS NORMAL. 3. TEST THE STATIC PRESSURE TEST: THE DIFFERENCE OF MEASURE DISPLAY VALUE AND STANDARD VALUE IS LESS THAN 3 MMHG, THE PRESSURE VALUE OF EACH POINT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCURACY. 4. TEST AIR LEAKAGE TEST: THE AIR LEAKAGE VALUE IS LESS THAN 6MMHG, THE TEST IS PASSED. IT INDICATES THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE VALVE IS NORMAL. 5. REAL PERSON TEST: DURING MEASUREMENT PROCESS AND NO PAIN FELT. CONCLUSION: THE AIR PUMP AND CUFF IS WORKING FUNCTIONALLY, AND THE DEVICE INFLATION/DEFLATION FUNCTION IS NORMAL DURING THE TESTING. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED AND AGREED BY TELADOC, AND THIS PROBLEM IS RELATED TO USER PERCEPTION. THE BELOW MISOPERATION WILL LEAD TO INFLATION ISSUE WHICH IS INCLUDED IN USER MANUAL. THE CUSTOMER DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERIENCE, THE CAUSES OF PATIENT DISCOMFORT CAUSED BY INFLATION/DEFLATION ISSUE AS FOLLOWINGS: 1) DURING THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS, IF THE USER HAS BODY OR ARM SHAKING, TALKING, OR THE USER HAS PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE/ARRHYTHMIA, ETC., IT WILL INTERFERE WITH THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT, THE INFLATION PRESSURE VALUE OF THE DEVICE WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED, AND THE PRESSURE ON THE ARM WILL BE MORE PRONOUNCED. 2) DURING THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS, IF THE USER WEARS THICKER CLOTHING, IT WILL INTERFERE WITH THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT, THE INFLATION PRESSURE VALUE OF THE DEVICE WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED, AND THE PRESSURE ON THE ARM WILL BE MORE PRONOUNCED. 3) THE MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLE OF THE SPHYGMOMANOMETER REQUIRES THAT THE CUFF BLADDER BE INFLATED TO A CERTAIN VALUE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE THE MEASUREMENT CAN BE COMPLETED (THE CUFF AIR PRESSURE MUST BE HIGHER THAN THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BY MORE THAN 30MMHG). IF THE USER HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (SUCH AS SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE 180MMHG, THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF WILL INFLATE MORE THAN 210MMHG WHEN MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE), UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESSURE FELT BY THE USER'S ARM WILL BE MORE THAN 30MMHG HIGHER THAN HIS/HER OWN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CORRECTIVE ACTION: 1. ESTABLISH A REGULAR COMMUNICATION MECHANISM WITH CUSTOMERS 2. PREPARING A DOCUMENT CONCERNING TROUBLESHOOTING AND ESSENTIAL PRECAUTIONS AS A NOTIFICATION OF REMINDER FOR CUSTOMER PROMOTION TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF USER MISOPERATIONS. CONCLUSION: THIS ISSUE WOULD NOT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO A DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, NOT A MDR EVENT.

The MAUDE database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory reporters (manufacturers; importers and device user facilities) and voluntary reporters such as health care professionals; patients and consumers. Each year; the FDA receives several hundred thousand medical device reports (MDRs) of suspected device-associated deaths; serious injuries and malfunctions. The FDA uses MDRs to monitor device performance; detect potential device-related safety issues; and contribute to benefit-risk assessments of these products. The MAUDE database houses MDRs submitted to the FDA by mandatory reporters (manufacturers; importers and device user facilities) and voluntary reporters such as health care professionals; patients and consumers.;;;;;;
Although MDRs are a valuable source of information; this passive surveillance system has limitations; including the potential submission of incomplete; inaccurate; untimely; unverified; or biased data. In addition; the incidence or prevalence of an event cannot be determined from this reporting system alone due to potential under-reporting of events and lack of information about frequency of device use. Because of this; MDRs comprise only one of the FDA's several important postmarket surveillance data sources.;;;;;;
MDR data alone cannot be used to establish rates of events; evaluate a change in event rates over time or compare event rates between devices. The number of reports cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence; severity; or frequency of problems associated with devices. Confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report. Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship is especially difficult if circumstances surrounding the event have not been verified or if the device in question has not been directly evaluated.;;;;;;;;;;;
MAUDE data does not represent all known safety information for a reported medical device and should be interpreted in the context of other available information when making device-related or treatment decisions. Variations in trade; product; and company names affect search results. Searches only retrieve records that contain the search term(s) provided by the requester.Submission of a medical device report and the FDA's release of that information is not necessarily an admission that a product; user facility; importer; distributor; manufacturer; or medical personnel caused or contributed to the event. Certain types of report information are protected from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).;;;;;;;
If a report contains trade secret or confidential business information;" that text is replaced by ""(b)(4)"". If a report contains personnel or medical files information";" that text is replaced by ""(b)(6)"". The designations ""(b)(4)"" and ""(b)(6)"" refer to the exemptions in the FOIA. For example";" ""(b)(4)"" may be found in place of the product's composition and ""(b)(6)"" may be found in place of a patient's age. MAUDE is updated monthly and the search page reflects the date of the most recent update. The FDA seeks to include all reports received prior to the update but the inclusion of some reports may be delayed.";;;;;;;;;;;
Manufacturers and importers must submit reports when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Manufacturers must send reports of such deaths; serious injuries and malfunctions to the FDA. Importers must send reports of deaths and serious injuries to the FDA and the manufacturer; and reports of malfunctions to the manufacturer.;;;;;;;;;;;;
Device user facilities include hospitals; outpatient diagnostic or treatment facilities; nursing homes and ambulatory surgical facilities. Device user facilities must submit reports when they become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury of a patient in their facility. Death reports must be sent to the FDA and the manufacturer; if known. Serious injury reports must be sent to the manufacturer or to the FDA; if the manufacturer is not known.;;;;;;;;;;
